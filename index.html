									<h2 class="major">About the WLG</h2>
									<p>The Women’s Leadership Group is a non-profit civil society organization interested in improving women’s participation in governance and civic leadership in Nigeria. The group evolved out of a leadership training meeting in 1995. Made up of senior journalists and political analysts, the WLG started meeting formally in June 1997. It was formally registered by Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in 2003. The group’s focus is driven by the fact that although women constitute <strong>50%</strong> of the population and <strong>51%</strong> of voters in Nigeria, they have never had more than <strong>7%</strong> representation in national government.</p>

									<p>The poor representation of women in government is both a product and a cause of the huge gender disparities in all indicators of human and national development in Nigeria. To become full partners in development, women must get into political and decision-making positions.</p>

									<p>One of the difficulties for Nigerian women seeking electoral and other decision-making positions has been poor media and campaign strategies and lack of mentoring support. Focusing on those areas of need, the Women’s Leadership Group has been organizing practical hands-on training in media and campaign skills for female political aspirants and those already in office. In addition to linking women aspirants to mentors, the WLG engages in training new leaders and gives such women a head start by linking them with helpful media practitioners to ensure adequate coverage of their campaigns or programmes. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Partners</h2>
									<p>The Women’s Leadership Group partners with non -governmental organizations, governments, national and international agencies, coalitions and alumni networks, within and outside Nigeria, which share similar goals. For instance, in 1998, just before the national elections in Nigeria, the WLG worked in collaboration with the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), New York to organize media and campaign skills training for female political aspirants in South -Western, Nigeria. Since 2000 the WLG has been in a continuing partnership with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation of Germany, providing training and support to various groups of female aspirants as well as female parliamentarians in Nigeria, particularly through strengthening their media skills and improving media usage.</p>
